# my_code

## This directory contains python code for different problems i have worked on.

## Repo Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used.
- `README.md`: Overview of the repo.
- `genomics.py` : contains solution for a problem, *'write a python script to find out largest and   smallest seq length and find out how many times
it is appearing in the given fasta file.' 
- `genomics1.py` : constains soluton for problem, *'find out the length of each sequence present in the given fasta file. find the length of largets and 
smallest sequence and how may time it has appeared.'
- `genomics2.py` : constains soluton for problem, *for a given fasta file, find total number of possible ORFs in each sequence. find the length of largest ORF along with its sequence id. mention the orf starting point inthat fasta sequence.
- `genomics2.py` : constains soluton for problem, *write a script to get all repeat sequences of specific length 'k' and also how may times this repeats 
are occuring in a given sequence. 
find out the most repeated k-mer with the number of time it is repeated.
- `oops_pro.py`: The concept of OOPS is used to create banking system and to determine persons age based on date of birth.
- `patterns.py` : this file contains code to print different patterns.
- `statistics.py` : Here, I have calculated mean, median, mode, variance of each column present 
in a csv file(maize_pheno.csv) from scratch and using different python libraries.
